console.log("blackjack");


// Blackjack pseudocode time :)

// Need to create objects/ object classes for cards in play
//   Start with one suit, once that's good, then go to one deck

// Look into logic of switch statements for handling of Ace values


// Minimum rules to implement for win conditions:
//   1.  Highest score <= 21 wins
//   2.  Ace is 1 or 10, depending on what is still <= 21
//   3.  Facecards all have a point value of 10
//   4.  Have to be able to start the game after window onload
//   5.  Must be able to hit or stand
//   6.  Dealer hits at 16, stands at 17
//   7.  Card dealing randomization: use Math.floor and Math.random to pick cards out of the array.
//   8.  Test in console or alerts first


// Must be worked out for minimum viable product
//   1.  Bets: deduct bet from wallet for the round
//   2.  Calculating a draw/ push scenario how that affects bank
//   3.  Maintain a wallet variable
//   4.  Hard lose conditions for when wallet gets below zero.
//   5.  Cannot have a green background
//   6.  Basic HTML and CSS layout


// Stretch:
//   1.  Create an escrow variable for where the bet goes while in play
//   2.  Instructions
//   3.  Split
//   4.  Double down
//   5.  Insurance
